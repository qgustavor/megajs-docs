# Platform compatibility

This library started as a fork of [tonistiigi's mega](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mega), which was focused to run on Node.js with claimed support based on Browserify (which seems to have stopped working somehow), so one of the reasons for the fork is to restore support for running it on browsers.

## Node.js

Following its origins, this library still focuses on Node.js and is mostly used and tested on this platform.

Version 1.2.0 added a change that made the library use the global `fetch` library when available instead of relying on `node-fetch`. All test cases are passing and none of the applications wrote by the librarie's author broke, so seems that's fine. If you have issues on that, debug the issue and send a pull request.

## Browsers

As stated in the beginning, one of the reasons for this fork was to restore browser support (so it could be used in [direct-mega](https://github.com/qgustavor/direct-mega)). Browser support was added by creating a browser version that uses pure-JS functions instead of Node.js equivalents (mostly crypto functions, in which case the crypto functions used are old ones tonistiigi used, with many fixes and improvements). The browser code is also tested in every release using Deno (which provides a similar environment to a browser).

## Deno

Deno is partially supported:

It can't connect to MEGA uploading and downloading servers due to issues related to weak TLS ciphers. That's something that cannot be fixed by this library and neither Deno developers ([source](https://github.com/denoland/deno/issues/6427#issuecomment-813662658)) nor MEGA developers ([source](https://mega.io/developers), quoted: "MEGAâ€™s HTTPS access supports most ciphers/hashes and uses [...] **RC4/MD5** [...]") want to fix.

Is still possible to use Deno by disabling HTTPS when uploading or downloading, but that's even worse than using MD5 and, because of that, the only choice for this library is not supporting Deno in the hope either Deno to enable support for weak ciphers (which are better than no cipher at all) or MEGA to support strong ciphers in all of their servers. Notice that, since MEGA works in browsers, seems that they enable strong ciphers depending on the user-agent. In fact, changing the user-agent that this library uses can affect a lot the behavior of MEGA's servers.

Besides downloading and uploading files, this library works perfectly on Deno. In fact, as stated above, it's used to test the browser builds of the library.

## Other JavaScript environments

Should work like Node.js or Deno, depending on how the environment handles weak TLS cyphers.
