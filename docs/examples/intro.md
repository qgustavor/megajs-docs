# Introduction

In this section there are code examples meant to be run using Deno.

[Deno](https://deno.com/) is a secure-by-default JavaScript runtime that allows code to be loaded and run from the Internet, so you can just run those examples by typing commands like `deno run https://mega.js.org/...` in your terminal, *which may look unsafe*, but it isn't as since Deno includes security features that allow you to know and permit (or not) the code to run dangerous actions, like reading or writing files, accessing environment variables, connecting to remote servers, and so on.

Code examples are sorted in those levels:

1. Simple examples that show how to use the library but aren't too useful on their own.
2. More advanced examples that might be useful for someone using this library to automate their workflow.
3. Complete single-file applications that might be sourced from real applications.
4. Advanced examples that aren't too useful but show some extra functionality of the library
