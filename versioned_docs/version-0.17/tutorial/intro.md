# Introduction

The most common usage of this library - at least as found in GitHub - is uploading files, but you can use it to download shared files and folders and manage files in accounts, like moving files, renaming, changing colors and marking files as favorites. Node is often used, but this library is also compatible with browsers.

This tutorial will guide you how to use most of the features of this library.

You can follow some of those examples in a browser. There are not any live examples because those examples need an MEGA account and, while this tutorial could prompt you to give your account credentials, is better to avoid that to improve security.
